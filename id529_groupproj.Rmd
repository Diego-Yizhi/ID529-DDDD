## Introduction

Welcome to our brief tutorial on data documentation and managing data dictionaries in R!

We have upload all materials on Github, you can access via:

![QR](our_github_repo.png)

Imagine you have inherited a dataset from a colleague, and you have been asked by your mentor to conduct an analysis. As you open the data and its files, you are relieved because your colleague has included substantial data documentation and data dictionary, which you know is a core component of conducting reproducible research and collaborating with other researchers. In particular, the data dictionary that your colleague has left you includes:

**Information about the data that you are using:**

-   where it came from, why it was collected, and who collected it

-   structure and format

-   variables included

-   missing data

-   key references, papers that have used these data, and further reading or resources

**Your colleague also offers some sage advice on how they documented the variables, emphasizing the importance of allowing other researchers to understand exactly what the values represent:**

-   type: are they binary, categorical, ordinal, string, dates, numeric, or other?

-   range, allowed values, and units

-   information on variables generated by the research team e.g., if they have been categorized or transformed, with references if appropriate

-   how missing data has been coded

## Dependencies for our tutorial

Now let's think about some of the packages that might help us with data documentation and data dictionaries. These packages are, "labelled", "codebook", and "dataMeta". First, let's make sure we have installed our dependencies. We will use the ID529 NHANES dataset for demonstrative purposes.

```{r dependencies, include = TRUE, results = 'hide', message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}

# Let's install our data dictionary packages
install.packages("labelled", repos="http://cran.us.r-project.org")
install.packages("codebook", repos="http://cran.us.r-project.org")
install.packages("dataMeta", repos="http://cran.us.r-project.org")

# Load libraries
library(labelled)
library(codebook)
library(dataMeta)

# Let's bring up our ID529 NHANES data. 
devtools::install_github("ID529/ID529data")

# Load NHANES PFAS data 
data(nhanes_id529, package = 'ID529data')
```

## Package 1: labelled

The "labelled" package allows us to generate data dictionaries, and apply and retrieve variable labels, value labels, and special missing values (e.g., 88 from SPSS). Let's take a brief tour through its key functions. Note that these functions are used to generate data dictionaries using the "codebook" package as well (see the next section).

```{r}
# Labeling variables using var_label(data)
var_label(nhanes_id529$sex_gender) <- "Sex assigned at birth"
var_label(nhanes_id529$poverty_ratio) <- "Poverty ratio as calculated as the ratio of persons who is living below the poverty line"

# Calling var_label(data$var) again will retrieve label
var_label(nhanes_id529$sex_gender)

# labelled(): we can create a vector with labelled values. Note these vectors wonâ€™t work for analysis; must convert to factor, numeric, etc. before using them
# labelled(value_vector, value_labels_vector) 

# To generate a data dictionary; variable, label, column type, and values are default outputs, and the option "details = TRUE" generates more details. 
look_for(nhanes_id529, details = TRUE)
```

## Package 2: codebook

The `codebook` package will automatically format metadata, summary statistics, missing tables, and a codebook based on your data. It is used in conjunction with the 'labelled' package. The following code generates a full codebook using your data. This includes summary statistics for each variable, a missing report, and the codebook. The package allows you to modify labels and metadata, and can also work with metadata from Stata and SPSS. To create codebook, run `codebook::new_codebook_rmd()` in your console, which will load a new R markdown file with preset defaults.

An overview of the package can be found at: <https://rubenarslan.github.io/codebook/index.html>. A helpful tutorial on creating and updating the codebook can be found here: <https://rubenarslan.github.io/codebook/articles/codebook_tutorial.html>.

We can generate a codebook summary alongside summary statistics for each variable (output suppressed)

```{r codebook, message = FALSE, results = 'hide'}
# Generate codebook and summary statistics for each variable
codebook (nhanes_id529)
```

But do let us look at what the codebook summary looks like.

```{r, message = FALSE}
# Generate codebook only (without summary statistics)
compact_codebook(nhanes_id529)
```

## Package 3: dataMeta

dataMeta is another great option to help us build a data dictionary, specifically through the creation of "linkers". A linker can be thought of as an intermediary to build the data dictionary. It will contain the names of the variables, a description of each variable provided, and a "variable type", which will give each variable a value of 1 or 0.

For variable type = 0, these are for those variables that have options that can be portrayed as a range of values. For example, age or dates or any categorical factors, and for those that that the user does not want to list out (NA values will be maintained).

For Variable type = 1, these are those variables that have options that need to be listed and/or described later on.

```{r}
# Generate the description of variables
var_desc <- c("Unique identifier for individuals in NHANES",
              "Race/Ethnicity",
              "Sex/Gender [as binary]",
              "Age [in years] at screening",
              "Ratio of Household Income to US Federal Poverty Line",
              "Days [Reported] Respondents Floss per Week [days/week]",
              "Perfluoroalkyl and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances [ng/mL]",
              "Perfluorooctane Sulfonate [ng/mL]",
              "Perfluorooctanoic Acid [ng/mL]",
              "Perfluorononanoic Acid [ng/mL]",
              "Perfluorohexane Sulfonate [ng/mL]",
              "Perfluorodecanoic Acid [ng/mL]",
              "Calories in Daily Dietary Intake [reported] [kCal]",
              "Calories from fast food excluding popcorn and seafood in daily dietary recall [kCal]",
              "Calories from food at restaurants excluding popcorn and seafood in daily dietary recall [kCal]",
              "Calories from food that is not from fast food or restaurants excluding popcorn and seafood in dietary recall [kCal]",
              "Calories from popcorn in dietary recall [kCal]",
              "Calories from shellfish in dietary recall [kCal]",
              "Calories from fish in dietary recall [kCal]",
              "Mean Systolic Blood Pressure [mm Hg]",
              "Weight [kg]",
              "Height [cm]"
              )

# Generate the type of variables
var_type <- c(0,1,1,rep(0,19))

# Create linker
linker <- build_linker(nhanes_id529, 
                       variable_description = var_desc,
                       variable_type = var_type)

# Let's view our linker
View(linker)
```

Here, `option_description` is set to NULL because the options of each variable are self explanatory, thus the dictionary will not contain a description for each variable option.

If option_descriptions are added, then a vector of each option description is constructed. The length of this vector needs to be the same as the number of rows in the dictionary and it will depend on the the variable_type used in the linker.

Another way to add option descriptions is to use the `prompt_varopts` function, which prompts the user for a description of each variable option, without the need to write the descriptions vector beforehand. If using this option, then prompt_varopts must be set to TRUE and option_description must be NULL. Notice that variable names will be automatically sorted alphabetically.

```{r option_description}
option_desc <- c("Range: 12 - 80",
                 "Range: 0 - 7",
                 "Range: 0 - 7539",
                 "Range: 0 - 1518",
                 "Range: 135.4 - 197",
                 "Range: 73568 - 83726",
                 "Range: 83.33 - 216.67",
                 "Range: 0 - 10765",
                 "Range: 0.49 - 1423.1",
                 "Range: 0.07 - 51.3",
                 "Range: 0.07 - 33.9",
                 "Range: 0.07 - 16.3",
                 "Range: 0.14 - 85.27",
                 "Range: 0.14 - 1403",
                 "Range: 0 - 852",
                 "Range: 0 - 5",
                 "Non-Hispanic White",
                 "NA's",
                 "Non-Hispanic Black",
                 "Hispanic",
                 "Range: 0 - 3424",
                 "Female",
                 "Male",
                 "Range: 0 - 1039",
                 "Range: 130 - 12108",
                 "Range: 29.8 - 173.7"
                 )

dict <- build_dict(my.data = nhanes_id529, linker = linker, 
                   option_description = option_desc,
                   prompt_varopts = FALSE)

# If you want to export this dictionary:
# write.csv(dict, file = here::here("outputs","data_dictionary.csv"))
```
